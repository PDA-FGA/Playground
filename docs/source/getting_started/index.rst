Getting started
=================================


Hygia is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data pipeline configuration 
through a YAML file to make working with Machine Learning data easy and intuitive. It consists of 
helping developers and users to register, organize, compare and share all their ML model metadata in 
a single place, facilitating the generation of requirements in the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process. 
Thus, the migration can be scaled, automated, and accelerated for similar contexts.
